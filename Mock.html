                    of aviation,
                    
                      
                    there is no way a bee
                    should be able to fly.
                    
                      
                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.
                    
                      
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway
                    
                      
                    because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.

                <li><a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html">Of course. Most bee jobs are</a>
                        small ones. But bees know
                        
                          
                        that every small job,
                        if it's done well, means a lot.
                        
                          
                        But choose carefully
                        
                          
                        because you'll stay in the job
                        you pick for the rest of your life.
                        
                          
                        The same job the rest of your life?
                        I didn't know that.
                        
                          
                        What's the difference?
                        
                          
                        You'll be happy to know that bees,
                        as a species, haven't had one day off
                        
                          
                        in 27 million years.
                        
                          
                        So you'll just work us to death?
                        
                          
                        We'll sure try.
