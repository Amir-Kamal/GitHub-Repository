                The blaster type weapons are known for their one shot kill potential and their unique exploding projectile.
                Where the rapid differs from its high damage brethren is its increased range and increased rate of fire,
                though this does come at the cost of the explosion radius and damage that typical blasters are known for.
                Even though the damage is reduced the rapid blaster is able to splat players within two shots of a direct 
                hit or three shots with the splash damage out of range from all other weapons outside of chargers and 
                heavy splatlings. To succeed with the weapon is to keep foes at a distance and abusing the burst projectile 
                against enemies who inist to hide on tall ledges or behind walls. Use the ink mine to cut off chokes to alert
                and your teammates of your foes impending advance, and when thats not enough to deter them from coming to close
                unleash your bomb rush special to deny turf and and clear a path for your allies.
